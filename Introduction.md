Introduction/ Business Problem:

Average number of car accidents in the U.S. every year is 6 million. 3 million people in the U.S. are injured every year in car accidents. Analysing the conditions that contribute to these accidents would lead to the prevention of significant loss of life and financial resources.

The project is aimed at predicting the severity of a car accident given the weather, road and visibility conditions in order to reduce the frequency of car collusions in a community based on dataset provided by Seattle PD. 
Consequently, this analysis would aide drivers to exercise more caution while driving or even choose an alternative route or time for their travel if possible. It could also potentially help the local government, the police department and car insurance providers to gain deeper insight into road accidents.
