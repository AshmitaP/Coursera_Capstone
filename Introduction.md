##Introduction/Business Problem

The project is aimed at predicting the severity of a car accident given the weather, road and visibility conditions in order to reduce the frequency of car collusions in a community based on dataset provided by Seattle PD. Consequently, this analysis would aide drivers to exercise more caution while driving or even choose an alternative route or time for their travel if possible.
