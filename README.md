## Coursera Capstone: Car Accident Severity

This is a repository for the Capstone project included in the Applied Data Science Specialization by IBM on Coursera.

Dataset Used:
  
The detailed dataset of all road collisions as provided by the Seattle PD (since 2004) can be found [here](https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv).The dataset consists of 37 independent fields and 194673 records, which includes both numerical and categorical data. The dependent field or label for the data set is SEVERITYCODE, which describes the fatality of an accident. The values under this label are categorised into fatality (3), serious injury (2b), injury (2), prop damage (1) and unknown (0).

Introduction/Business Problem:
  
Average number of car accidents in the U.S. every year is 6 million. 3 million people in the U.S. are injured every year in car accidents. Analysing the conditions that contribute to these accidents would lead to the prevention of significant loss of life and financial resources.

The project is aimed at predicting the severity of a car accident given the location, weather, road and visibility conditions in order to reduce the frequency of car collusions in a community based on dataset provided by Seattle PD. Consequently, this analysis would aid drivers to exercise more caution while driving or even choose an alternative route or time for their travel if possible. It could also potentially help the local government, the police department and car insurance providers to gain deeper insight into road accidents.
