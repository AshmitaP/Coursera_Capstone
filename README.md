## Coursera Capstone: Car Accident Severity

This is a repository for the Capstone project included in the Applied Data Science Specialization by IBM on Coursera.
<h4>Dataset Used
The detailed dataset of all road collisions as provided by the Seattle PD (since 2004) can be found [here](https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv).

<h4>Introduction/Business Problem
The project is aimed at predicting the severity of a car accident given the weather, road and visibility conditions in order to reduce the frequency of car collusions in a community based on dataset provided by Seattle PD. Consequently, this analysis would aide drivers to exercise more caution while driving or even choose an alternative route or time for their travel if possible.
